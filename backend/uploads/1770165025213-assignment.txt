Topic : Client-Server (Socket)
Practise Assignment
Important Instructions:
1. Using Linux
a. This assignment is based on Network programming and will be
beneficial for the students to do this assignment in a Linux OS.
b. If you don't have linux, use virtualbox + linux image, both free. We
suggest Ubuntu, but feel free to use any linux version.If you decide to use cygwin
or wsl, it's up to you, just remember that most of your batch mates (and the
instructors) will use Linux (and ubuntu), so, naturally, we might not be able to
provide support for other systems.
2. Programming language
a. This assignment is using the C programming language. You can also
use cpp (without STL) if you want, as the important calls remain mostly the
same.
3. Error handling
a. A proper error handling (e.g., when the syscall or the library calls fail) is
expected in this Assignment.
Part 1) Basic TCP Client-Server
You are tasked with implementing a simplified Client-Server messaging system
using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the C programming language. The
objective is to enable the client to send messages to the server, with the server
responding by sending acknowledgments. Your implementation should include
both client and server components.
​
Part - I (Server Implementation)​
​Implement a Server that can handle incoming message requests from a single
client using
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The server should respond to each
message from the client with an acknowledgment, ensuring reliable
communication between the client and the server.
Requirements:
1.​Create a TCP server that listens on a specific port and accepts a single
client connection at a
Time.
2.​Receive messages from the client, print them on the server side, and
send an
acknowledgement back to the client.
3.​Close the connection gracefully when the client sends an exit command.
Part - II (Client Implementation)​
Implement a client that sends messages to the server and receives
acknowledgement from the
server.
Requirements:
1.​Connect to the server using the server's IP and port.
2.​Allow the user to input messages and send them to the server.
3.​Display the acknowledgment received from the server.
4.​Implement a command (exit) to terminate the connection.
Part 1.1 ) Extended TCP Client-Server
You are tasked with implementing a simplified Client-Server messaging system
using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the C programming language. The
objective is to enable multiple clients to send messages to the server
concurrently, with the server responding to each message by sending an
acknowledgment and log the client messages with IP addresses and timestamps. ​
​
Part - I (Server Implementation)​
Implement a Server that can handle multiple incoming message requests from
clients
simultaneously using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The server should
respond to each
client's message with an acknowledgment.
Requirements:
1.​Modify the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
2.​Implement proper synchronization to protect shared resources, such as
writing to a log file
(log.txt) that stores client messages along with IP addresses and
timestamps.
Part - II (Client Implementation)
Implement a client that sends messages to the server and receives
acknowledgement from the
server.
Requirements:
1.​Use the existing client from Section A with minimal changes.
2.​Test the client by connecting multiple instances to the server
concurrently.
Part 2) Ping command
You are assigned to implement a simplified version of the ping command using
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the C programming language. The goal
is to measure the round-trip time (RTT) between a client and a server. Your
implementation should include both a client and a server.
​
Part - I (Server Implementation)
Implement a Server that can handle multiple incoming ping requests from clients.
The server
should respond to each client's ping request with an acknowledgment. The
server should be able to handle concurrent ping requests from different clients.
Requirements:
1.​Upon receiving a ping request, the server should respond with an
acknowledgment
containing the same payload included in the ping.
2.​Implement a mechanism to handle packet loss or timeouts (e.g.,
retransmission of
acknowledgement).
3.​The server should log each incoming ping request, including the source
IP address, port, and RTT in a file.
4.​The server should be able to handle multiple ping requests
simultaneously. You need to protect the logfile, so that multiple ping
handler processes are not overwriting the file.​
Part - II (Client Implementation)
Implement a client that sends ping requests to the server and measures the
round-trip time. The
client should be capable of sending multiple ping requests to the server.
Requirements:
1.​Implement a mechanism to send ping requests to the server.
2.​The client should measure the round-trip time (RTT)---the time
difference between sending a ping request and receiving the
acknowledgment.
3.​Display the acknowledgment from the server along with the RTT.
4.​Your ping client should allow users (from the command line) to specify
the server ip, the number of ping requests, the interval between requests
and the port to send the ping.
Part 3) FTP
You are tasked with implementing a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and client
in the C
programming language using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The FTP
system should support basic file transfer operations, including put, get, close, cd
(change directory), and ls (list directory contents) from the client to the server as
follows:
1.​put <file_name>: Upload a file from the client to the server in the current
directory.
2.​get <file_name>: Download a file from the server to the client in the current
directory.
3.​close: Close the connection with the client.
4.​cd <directory_name>: Change the current directory on the server.
5.​ls: List all the contents of the current directory on the server available to the
client.
Part - I (Server Implementation)
Implement an FTP server that can handle file transfer requests from multiple
clients concurrently.
The server should support the commands
Requirements:
1.​The server should bind to a specific port to listen for incoming FTP
commands.
2.​The server should handle multiple concurrent connections.
Part - II (Client Implementation)
Implement an FTP client that allows users to connect to the FTP server and
perform file transfer
operations. The client should support the commands
Requirements:
1.​Implement a mechanism to establish a connection with the server (using
the known port).
2.​Implement a simple user interface prompt (ftp_client>) for the client to
enter FTP
commands.
3.​Display appropriate messages for success or failure of file operations.
